"""Inheritance is the process by which a class can inherit or derive the properties(or data) and methods(or
functions) of another class. Simply, the process of inheriting the properties of a parent class into a child class is
known as inheritance.

The class whose properties are inherited is the Parent class, and the class that inherits the properties from the
Parent class is the Child class."""
